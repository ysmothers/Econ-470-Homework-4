NOTES:
(1) Includes Type I or Type II Diabetes Mellitus.
"(2) Beneficiaries with the three-way interaction RF*CHF*DM are excluded from the two-way interactions DM*CHF and RF*CHF. Thus, the three-way interaction term RF*CHF*DM is not additive to the two-way interaction terms DM*CHF and RF*CHF. Rather, it is hierarchical to, and excludes these interaction terms. A beneficiary with all three conditions is not ""credited"" with the two-way interactions. All other interaction terms are additive."
(3) HCC or disease interaction excluded from institutional model because estimated coefficient less than 0 or t-statistic less than 1.0.
"The 2007 denominator of $7,463.14 used to calculate both the community and institutional factors is the national predicted average annual cost under the model."
DM is diabetes mellitus (HCCs 15-19).
CHF is congestive heart failure (HCC 80).
COPD is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HCC 108).
"CVD is cerebrovascular disease (HCCs 95, 96, 100, and 101)."
CAD is coronary artery disease (HCCs 81-83).
RF is renal failure (HCC 131).
