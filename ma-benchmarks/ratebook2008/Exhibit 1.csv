1This model is used for those enrollees who have a full year of base year claims data,,
"2Mean Year 2003 Total Expenditures=$60,471.  Mean is over all dialysis patients including those with Medicare as secondary payer.",,
,,
3Coefficients of variables with unconstrained coefficients less than 0 were constrained to equal 0.,,
4Coefficients of variables with coefficients with t-statistics < 1.0 were constrained to equal 0.,,
5Coefficient was constrained to equal coefficient from the CMS-HCC Aged-Disabled Community Model (2002-2003 Calibration).,,
"6The interaction DM_CHF_RF (where RF = renal failure) is the same in this population as DM_CHF because all sample members have renal failure.  Hence, this three-way interaction is not included.",,
7These coefficients are set to zero because beneficiaries on whom the model is calibrated have renal failure and are in dialysis status.,,
