,,,,,
"1To determine payments for persons with functioning grafts, the computed risk score should be applied to the appropriate cell in the CMS-HCC county risk ratebook for the aged and disabled.  For payment in any month, duration is measured from the month of transplant to the first day of that month.  All coefficients except for the graft factors and HCC174 were constrained to the values estimates for the 2003 Calibration CMS-HCC Aged-Disabled Community Model.",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
"2_______ means coefficients of HCCs are constrained to be equal, and C1 denotes a non-continguous constraint.  For the community model C1=.446; for the institutional model C1=.224.",,,,,
,,,,,
3Kidney failure and Dialysis status HCCs are not captured in the model for functioning graft beneficiaries.  The cost of treating their transplanted kidney is captured instead in the post-graft factors.  Should a post-graft patient have failure again they would return to dialysis status and be paid under the dialysis model.,,,,,
4Diseases in interactions are:  ,,,,,
       DM is diabetes mellitus (HCCs 15-19),,,,,
       CHF is congestive heart failure (HCC 80),,,,,
       COPD is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HCC 108),,,,,
"       CVD is cerebrovascular disease (HCCs 95,96,100, and 101)",,,,,
       RF is renal failure (HCC 131),,,,,
"Beneficiaries with the three-way interaction RF*CHF*DM are excluded from the two-way interactions DM*CHF and RF*CHF. Thus, the three-way interaction term RF*CHF*DM is not additive to the two-way interaction terms DM*CHF and RF*CHF. Rather, it is hierarchical to, and excludes these interaction terms. A beneficiary with all three conditions is not ""credited"" with the two-way interactions. All other interaction terms are additive. ",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
5These HCCs are not present in the institutional model.,,,,,
"6The graft factors are additive, similar to any other factors in the CMS-HCC model.  The factor is higher during the months immediately after transplant to account for a high level of monitoring and services.",,,,,
