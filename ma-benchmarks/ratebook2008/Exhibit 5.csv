"How Payments are Made with a Disease Hierarchy -- EXAMPLE: If a beneficiary triggers HCCs 148 (Decubitus Ulcer of the Skin) and 149 (Chronic Ulcer of Skin, Except Decubitus), then HCC 149 will be dropped. In other words, payment will always be associated with the HCC in column 1 if a HCC in column 3 also occurs during the same collection period. Therefore, the MA organization’s payment will be based on HCC 148 rather than HCC 149. ",,
