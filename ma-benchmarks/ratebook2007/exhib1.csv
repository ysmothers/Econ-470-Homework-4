1Includes Type I or Type II Diabetes Mellitus.,,,,,
"2Beneficiaries with the three-way interaction RF*CHF*DM are excluded from the two-way interactions DM*CHF and RF*CHF. Thus, the three-way interaction term RF*CHF*DM is not additive to the two-way interaction terms DM*CHF and RF*CHF.  Rather, it is hierarchical to, and excludes these interaction terms.  All other interaction terms are additive.",,,,,
,,,,,
DM is diabetes mellitus (HCCs 15-19).,,,
CHF is congestive heart failure (HCC 80).,,,
COPD is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HCC 108).,,,
"CVD is cerebrovascular disease (HCCs 95, 96, 100, and 101).",,,
CAD is coronary artery disease (HCCs 81-83).,,,
RF is renal failure (HCC 131).,,,
