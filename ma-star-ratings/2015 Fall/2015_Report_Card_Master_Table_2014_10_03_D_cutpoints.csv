"* Due to rounding and the placement of the predetermined 4-star cutoff, no contracts were assigned 3 base stars; all contracts meeting the cutoff for 3 base stars also met the cutoff for 4 base stars. However after application of the further criteria of significance and reliability, some plans with fewer than 3 base stars may have been assigned 3 final stars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
